## What is AWS EventBridge?

AWS EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that you can use to connect your applications to AWS services, SaaS applications, and web applications. EventBridge can collect data from these sources and route them to targets, such as AWS Lambda functions, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, and Amazon S3 buckets.
