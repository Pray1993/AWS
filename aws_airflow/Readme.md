## What is AWS Airflow?

AWS Airflow is a web service that you can use to author, schedule, and monitor workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. Using Airflow, you can author workflows for data pipelines and run them at specified dates and times. You can also programmatically author workflows, define dependencies between tasks, and monitor them.
